For linting in Java project, Checkstyle is a widely used tool for basic formatting rules. It's easy to set up and highly configurable, so it can be customised for the projects needs.
For testing Java applications typically use JUnit for unit and integration testing, which can be combined with mocking framworks like Mockito, to ensure good test coverage. For building; Maven is a popular Java Build automation tool. It is open-source and can orchestrate multiple Java projects simultanously. It is quite complex, but has much more advanced features than other build automation tools.

Alternative CI solutions could include AWS CodePipeline, which could be a good choice if the application uses AWS services, since it can work directly with other existing AWS tools. Another choice could be GitLab, which could be a good alternative for Jenkings, as it provides full suite of open source on-premises tools for CI/CD pipelines

As the project doesn't seem too big it could be a good idea to use a cloud based solution, which offers scalability, ease of use and a minimal setup, and in a small scale applications might be more cost effective. Self hosted setups provide more control over the enviroment, and better data privacy, but is usually more expensive and requires more hardware. Factors that affect this decision include budget, resources such as room or hardware for servers, and security concerns.
